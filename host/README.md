###The Proxy
This project holds all pieces of a "proxy" which must be installed in the native platform.

The proxy is the component that makes it possible for the Web2Native Bridge breaking away from
Native Messaging's single application model.

The proxy would be a part of a "genuine" Web2Native Bridge implementation as well. It would
typically be a part of the operating system.
